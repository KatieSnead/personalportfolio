          <p>Individuals currently need multiple storage options, depending on the content; Katalogus provides a
            “one-stop-shop” solution that everyone can get behind! Katalogus is a cloud storage web application focused
            on the ability to organize and share all your content, web and personal, in one secure place.</p>

        <div class="cloud-problem">
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>Currently, client clients are typically having to go to PlatformX for documents, PlatformY for pictures and
            PlatformZ for links (articles / recipes / etc). This is frustrating and hard to manage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="cloud-solution">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>Katalogus is your only cloud platform that has the capability of storing files of all types: PDF, word
            documents, pictures, website links, and more! Plus, by keeping the platform simple in its interface and
            similar to other platforms, customers will have an easy time taking to jump to a new cloud service.</p>

            not

            From the prototype / usability test stage, I moved onto designing the entire platform. Shortly after
            completing a couple
            screens, I realized that there was a potential accessibility issue with the color scheme chosen. That was
            tested on a
            third party site and subsequently failed.
            <br><br>
            I used the same general color (maroon/purple) to signify elegance and power but also added in orange for a
            hint of
            excitement. With those two being the main colors, I chose complementary colors that aligned with a beautiful
            sunset.

            Julius Sans One was chosen as the primary brand front, with Cormorant as the secondary. These two fonts go
            well together
            because they are opposites on virtually every level. However, it was discovered that Cormorant, in smaller
            sizes,
            becomes difficult to read. With that knowledge, the font pairing choice was changed to Oswald and Montserrat
            to maintain
            hierarchy while also having a similar font style.
            <br><br>
            Based on the information architecture I had in mind and the feedback received, I followed the minor third
            typography
            scale for the landing page and the major second scale for the rest of the platform. The landing page starts
            off with an
            attention grabber with the “attention grabbing” size of 67 then working down the scale to 16 at the
            smallest.

                Each task was completed successfully by every participant; the only issue with tasks was the

              <p>During the second round of usability testing, both in-person and remote usability tests were
                conducted,
                and the project was submitted to a design critique multiple times to allow for further iterations and
                improvement.
                <br><br>
                In the design critique, it was recommended to use a type scale in order to choose the best size
                combinations, as well as recommended trying out a different font combination since the stroke weight
                of
                Cormorant cause legibility issues as it got smaller.
                <br><br>
                In the usability tests, my color choices were enforced by the participants. They also agreed that some
                type on the landing page could go larger to be more impactful.</p>

            <p>I put my iterations to test by creating multiple A/B tests to assess the usability and preference of
              design options.
              <ul>Designs tested were:
                <li>1. Overall color scheme (dark versus light)</li>
                <li>2. Background design of above-the-fold area of landing page (solid versus gradient)</li>
                <li>3. Styling of mobile log-in screen (full or partial gradient)</li>

            <p>The results were very strong, so there was no doubt in my mind how the participants felt -- each of the
              “winning” designs were implemented long term in the platform. </p>

            <p>Since a wide variety of individuals were being targeted with this platform, with the focus being saving,
              organizing, and sharing, I started with a mindmap to see what ideas came off of that. Two words in
              particular really stood out: catalogue and inventory, which then opened the flood gates for logo ideas.
              <br><br>
              When considering logos, I mimicked imagery of inventory tags, clouds, data groupings and paperclips. The
              paperclip idea was what continued -- a sturdy tool to hold together all your paperwork was the perfect
              idea
              for a sturdy platform to hold all your online content.

            <p>From there, I created a moodboard that displayed pictures of organization as well as companionship.

              Melgrim was chosen for the main brand typography, but it is not legible beyond the company name, so that

              how it has
              been chosen to remain. The only time Melgrim is used is with the company name itself.</p>

              Initially, I was very worried that there would really be no true solution to bringing in another player to
              the cloud
              storage marketplace. It is already saturated with big-hitters that can easily sweep a newcomer underwater.
              However, I
              was quick to find out that there are some holes in each of the platforms that would allow someone else to
              come in and
              succeed.
              <br><br>
              I focused a lot during my user research on keeping a flow in the survey while also keeping it short and
              simple. If done
              again, I would have dropped the idea of questions flowing together, understanding that each question is
              important
              in-and-of itself, and asked more well-rounded questions during my user research stage. I still had great
              information to
              go off of, but could have had even better research had I taken the time to do so.
              <br><br>
              I learned a great deal from this project, including the need to test font choices at all scales as well as
              choosing a
              color scheme with overlapping colors. Mistakes made early on were that the font choice did not scale well
              for smaller
              text and the color scheme looked great side by side, but was inaccessible when it came time to using
              colors
              chosen for
              buttons and other overlapping designs. I learned the importance of learning how to use “components” when
              designing
              rather than changing something in each frame when an update was made (yikes, I know).
              <br><br>
              This project, more than anything, made me painfully aware of both research and properly using the tool at
              hand. I
              believe wholeheartedly that research done properly at the front end will significantly improve the product
              near the back
              end (including stopping critical errors from being made that completely wastes time and effort!). I also
              see
              the power
              that design tools have and how valuable they can be in making design efficient, when used properly.
              <br><br>
              I am truly proud of this project all together, with it being my first project completed from start to
              finish, I am most
              proud of the persistence I had while working on the mockups. There were many times I was truly stuck,
              unable
              to figure
              out what the next step is. While working completely remote, with no true “team” to turn to, I found and
              utilized many
              resources so keep moving and to get assistance and collaboration to continue to build a great product.
              There
              were times
              where I felt like there was no light at the end of the tunnel, but I kept chugging along and now have a
              completed
              project that I can proudly put my name on!
              <br><br>
              I’d also like to thank you for taking the time to read / scroll / skim (whichever!) my case study. Please
              do
              not
              hesitate to reach out with any questions, I am more than happy to discuss any detail of this project.
